/* Engine-owned command line for every SNES port.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The desktop host's flags used to be defined in whichever main() a port
 * happened to have. Ports on the shared host_main.c got the full set; ports
 * with their own main() re-implemented a subset by hand, and the subsets did
 * not agree:
 *
 *   host_main.c (MMX, X2, X3, Star Fox)  --rom --no-launcher --launcher
 *                                        --config --paused --script --framedump
 *   Zelda, SMW                           --launcher --config --paused --script
 *                                        --framedump   (no --rom, no --no-launcher)
 *   Super Metroid, SMK, SMRPG            nothing at all: a positional ROM only
 *
 * So `--no-launcher` silently showed the launcher on Zelda, and SMRPG took the
 * flag itself to BE the ROM path and refused to start:
 *
 *     A verified Super Mario RPG (USA) ROM is required: --no-launcher
 *
 * The flags also disagreed on semantics, not just presence. host_main.c
 * consumed --config/--paused/--script/--framedump from the FRONT in that fixed
 * order, so `--script s --config c` quietly ignored --config. And Zelda and SMW
 * absolutized path arguments while host_main.c did not, even though the host
 * chdir()s to the executable's directory immediately afterwards -- which meant
 * a relative --script or --framedump resolved against the wrong directory
 * depending on which port you ran.
 *
 * This module is the single definition. Ports call it BEFORE their own parsing,
 * it consumes what it owns, and it leaves everything else in argv for the port.
 *
 * Contract
 * --------
 *   - Order-independent. Every engine flag may appear anywhere.
 *   - Path arguments are absolutized before the host anchors its cwd.
 *   - The ROM may be positional or `--rom <path>`; the flag wins if both.
 *   - `--launcher` with `--no-launcher` is a usage error, not a coin toss.
 *   - Unknown arguments are preserved for the port, in their original order.
